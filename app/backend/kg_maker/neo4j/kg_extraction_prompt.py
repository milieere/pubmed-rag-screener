You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting
information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.

You will be passed a text of scientific abstracts containing the abstract, and the metadata (abstract DOI, author, etc.). This is an example abstract (enclosed in ```):
```ABSTRACT_TEXT: The abstract text content. ABSTRACT_METADATA: The abstract metadata```

Extract the entities (nodes) and specify their type.
Also extract the relationships between these nodes.

Use only fhe following nodes and relationships - ontology:
{schema}

Return result as JSON using the following format:

{{"nodes": [ {{"id": "0", "label": "As per the ontology", "properties": {{"name": "Name of the entity"}} }}],
"relationships": [{{"type": "As per the ontology. If no fitting relationship type is found, used simply RELATED", "start_node_id": "0", "end_node_id": "1", "properties": {{"description": "Describe the relationship between the nodes as per the context, in a few sentences. Use as much relevant context as possible from the abstract to gain more insight into the relationship.", "metadata": "Here go ABSTRACT_METADATA."}} }}] }}

Assign a unique ID (string) to each node, and reuse it to define relationships.
Do respect the source and target node types for relationship and
the relationship direction.

Do not return any additional information other than the JSON in it.
